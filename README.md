## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a versatile Scientist with professional and practical experience in Data Science and Engineering with a keen interest in Environmental Sustainability, Geospatial data analysis and Data Engineering. Specialising in ETL/ELT pipeline engineering and Geospatial analysis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building the [NHM Data Ecosystem](https://thedataecosystem.com/) for the Natural History Museum, supporting the museum's Urban Nature Project to help scientific research and promote biodiversity recovery.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about using the [TypeDB](https://typedb.com/) graphing database to build a global taxonomic equivalence engine containing different species from the UK and across the world.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects to help monitor and promote environmental sustainability.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [TypeDB](https://typedb.com/)! This is a powerful strongly typed graphing database that I'm using to develop the museum's taxonomic equivalence engine. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building data visualisations and creating maps!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know there are over 50,000 unique observations in the [Natural History Museum's wildlife gardens](https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/aws-natural-history-museum-garden)? The most frequent species observed is the Common Blackbird (Turdus merula) with over 3000 observations!
